To-Do:
    > Fix enemy shooting (accurate shooting, won't shoot unless player is in line of sight, move only if player is in line of sight)
    > Add randomized enemy drops (powerups)
    > Add autoaim
    > Fix bullet collision detection
        > Move bullet in increments (decided by smallest sprite) for each position update to make high bullet speeds possible and increase collision detection accuracy

    > Add items:
        > Jetpack
        > Higher Jump
        > Triple Jump
        > Increased defense
        > Health regen

    > Add more enemies
    > Add a final boss with a final boss room

    > Make player inventory
    > Make player creation system
    > Make shop for items

        > Add "block breaking" overlay sprite

    > Make better terrain generation system (Try Tiled)
    > Beautify
        > Realistic (on ground) collectibles
        > Animated player + enemies
        > Add better background
            > Draw distant + slow clouds first
        > Add more blocks
        > Add text to HP bar
        > Add good sound effects / music
        > Make coins sit on ground instead of float

    > Optimize (Make faster)
        > Only render what is visible (i.e. out of screen bounds)
        > Simplify code
        > Modularize code and split into separate files
            > Put global variables in separate file, import that file into all other files that require it
            
        > Add small delays to computationally-intensive tasks using game ticks
        > Research more optimizations

    > Create story + progression

    > Add Godmode

    > DEADLINE: June 10th
