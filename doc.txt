    > STORY:
        > Doofenheim is a sentient robot that finds himself in a world deep underground without humans, only robots.
        > A directive flashes at the beginning: "Get to the surface".
        > Doofenheim must travel forwards through the bases and lay down checkpoints. The bases
        are part of one continuous world, and when Doofenheim dies, he respawns at the checkpoints.
        The checkpoints are copies of Doofenheim's body that contain everything he had at the moment of the checkpoint's creation
        plus the memories and experiences he gains until his death.
        > As Doofenheim traverses the world and finds new bases, he collects items that allow him to upgrade himself permanently (the checkpoints are also upgraded).
        > Each "level" ends with a boss. Doofenheim's progression throughout the level will determine his ability to beat the boss.
            > Each boss is unique, and Doofenheim will not know anything about the boss until he encounters it for the first time. If Doofenheim dies, he will respawn at his last checkpoint,
            which will be automatically placed before the boss encounter if he has not already placed a checkpoint in that level before.

        > Doofenheim will keep a database of the items, enemies, blocks, and other things he encounters, and will learn new crafting recipes as he gains knowledge of his surroundings.
            > Each level will contain "hints" at the story that Doofenheim will encounter upon beating the boss. Beating a boss will initiate a cutscene in which Doofenheim will learn more of the world's past.
            > These "stories" will be structured as infomercials. At first, they'll concern the educational stuff about society, then progressively get more ominous until, upon reaching the surface, Doofenheim learns
            of the world's plight.

        > Humanity was making great progress. Then it nearly got destroyed. Eventually, the player learns that Doofenheim was the man that almost destroyed the world, but he saw what he's done at the last moment and isolated
        himself in the very bottom of the Earth's crust in Antarctica. He designed a robotic body and brain and a labyrinth that would teach him to be the strong man he never was. He stripped his mind of all memories and instincts
        and created a sentient AI in which he would implant his consciousness, which turned out to be a quantum-entagled substance.
        > Doofenheim gains his memories later on.
        > Make it a funny game: "Don't kill people that aren't trying to kill anyone else!" Funny quotes - as if tutorial on how to be human. Also serious.

    > Add Godmode

    > DEADLINE: June 10th
